  <!-- Note that, although m4 is a 'buildsupport' tool, we do NOT
       add the buildsupport="yes" attribute.  If we did, then this would
       ALWAYS be built at the beginning of the bootstrap process.
       Instead, we want to build it only if the system m4 is not GNU m4.
       Thus set the attribute to be "noauto", which causes the correct
       build rule to be generated (by GenerateDependencies.java), but does
       not include it in the list of buildsupport dependencies, so that it
       is not build automatically. -->
