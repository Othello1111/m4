#  Instead, it is a bootstrap script used for thirdparty buildsupport
#  directories that require some of their files time ordering restored after a
#  checkout from a repository (but are not part of a normal recursive
#  bootstrap), that is it works with a bootstrap_timeorder file containing a
#  list of local files that should be touched in a specific order to stop the
#  automatic re-generation of comitted files, like Makefile.in, configure
#  etc., when they look out of date wrt to their Makefile.am, configure.ac
#  etc.
#  
#  Look for a file "bootstrap_timeorder" in the local directory, if
#  found just read each line and touch the existing files in turn.
#  Need to sleep between touches as the resolution of these times
#  is usually about 1 second (so keep the files to be touched to a 
#  minimum).
