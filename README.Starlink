This is a slightly patched version of GNU m4.

To import a new release, add the new source to the vendor branch and merge to
master. At this point, resolve any conflicts that have arisen and finally
regenerate the build system by running autoreconf to include the patches for
manifest and component.xml.

Note that the bootstrap file restores the timestamp ordering and nothing
else. The original m4 functionality is not used.
