This is a slightly patched version of GNU m4.

This was originally imported as m4 1.4, and then updated to 1.4.1 (see
the FSF vendor branch for details).

The differences consist of those few changes needed to weave the
package into the Starlink build system, and can be seen with the
command

    % cvs diff -r FSF

To import a new release, follow the usual instructions for doing a
CVS import, for example:

    % cd /tmp
    % tar xzf m4-1.4.1.tar.gz
    % cd m4-1.4.1
    % cvs -d $starcvs import -m "Import of m4 1.4.1" \
        thirdparty/fsf/m4 FSF m4-1-4-1
    % cd /tmp
    % cvs -d $starcvs co -jm4-1-4 -jm4-1-4-1 thirdparty/fsf/m4
    % cd thirdparty/fsf/m4

At this point, resolve any conflicts that have arisen.

It's not completely clear what to do next.

When m4 is being built as part of the Starlink build system, it is
built in a context which does not have any of the autotools available,
it is therefore important that it does not call any.  CVS preserves
timestamps on checkout, though it doesn't on updates, what's checked
in, therefore, must be checked out in such a way that stamp-h.in is no
older than configure.in, aclocal.m4 and acconfig.h, and configure no
older than configure.in and aclocal.m4.  Note that CVS appears to use
the one-second-resolution _commit_ time as a timestamp in the
repository.  What's currently in the repository (2005 January 26)
appears to work, but it would be nice to feel this was less fragile.

Perhaps update these instructions when this is next updated.
