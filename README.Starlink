This is a slightly patched version of GNU m4.

This was originally imported as m4 1.4, and then updated to 1.4.1 (see
the FSF vendor branch for details).

The differences consist of those few changes needed to weave the
package into the Starlink build system, and can be seen with the
command

    % cvs diff -r FSF

To import a new release, follow the usual instructions for doing a
CVS import, for example:

    % cd /tmp
    % tar xzf m4-1.4.1.tar.gz
    % cd m4-1.4.1
    % cvs -d $starcvs import -m "Import of m4 1.4.1" \
        thirdparty/fsf/m4 FSF m4-1-4-1
    % cd /tmp
    % cvs -d $starcvs co -jm4-1-4 -jm4-1-4-1 thirdparty/fsf/m4
    % cd thirdparty/fsf/m4

At this point, resolve any conflicts that have arisen, and regenerate
configure from configure.in.  This need not be done using the Starlink
autoconf, but it shouldn't matter.  Use a similar autotools version,
though (the import of 1.4.1 was done using 2.57, which is the same
version that Starlink autoconf is based on).  Use autoreconf, and
ignore the deprecation warnings.

Commit the result.
